The server is started first and then the client is connected to the server. A simple TCP/IP client-server communication allows systems to communicate even if they use different types of network hardware.The choices of server and client are shared with each other so as to display them on the client side as well as the server side to update the status of the grid. This is done using the send() and recv() functions where we send the choice and size of the choice variable along with the socket descriptor. The client starts the game and the server follows, whoever succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
